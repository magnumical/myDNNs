# myDNNs
I upload the models I use in KERAS here!
For now, I uploaded 
wide residual networks (WRNs), ResNets, VGG-19, VGG16, LeNet-5.

For WNR: you can specify depth and scale of model!
for ResNet: You have RN18,50,101,150



### you need to install these packages:
1. [Keras_Resnet](https://github.com/broadinstitute/keras-resnet)

Also I used [KERAS_WRN](https://github.com/hypnopump/keras-wrn) to build the one used here.
